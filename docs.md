Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on Thursday shared what he called "smoking-gun documents" proving Facebook censored Americans on behalf of the Biden administration in a lengthy social media thread.

Jordan wrote the all-caps message, "THE FACEBOOK FILES, PART 1: SMOKING-GUN DOCS PROVE FACEBOOK CENSORED AMERICANS BECAUSE OF BIDEN WHITE HOUSE PRESSURE," before diving into the lengthy thread reminiscent of the so-called "Twitter Files" used earlier this year to disclose once-internal documents given to journalists once Elon Musk bought the social media platform.
